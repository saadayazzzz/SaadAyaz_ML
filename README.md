# Question No.1
# Permutation Finder

This Python script finds all permutations of a given array of numbers using backtracking.

## Usage

Enter a list of numbers separated by commas when prompted.

## Example

If you input the following list: [1, 2, 3], the script will find all permutations:

Enter the elements of the array: 1, 2, 3
The total permutations are: [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2]]

## How It Works

The script uses a backtracking algorithm to generate all permutations of the input array.

# Question No.2

# STL-10 Image Classification with ResNet-50 and Mixed Precision Training

This Python code demonstrates image classification using the STL-10 dataset with the ResNet-50 architecture. It also incorporates mixed precision training for improved training speed and memory efficiency.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy

You can install PyTorch and torchvision via pip:


## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code.

3. Run the code by executing the following command:

4. The code will start training the ResNet-50 model on the STL-10 dataset. During training, you will see epoch-wise loss values displayed in the console.

5. After training is complete, the code will evaluate the model's performance on the validation and test sets and display the accuracy.

## Configuration

You can customize the following configuration parameters in the code:

- `BATCH_SIZE`: The batch size for training and evaluation. You can adjust this value based on your GPU memory.

- `GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS`: The number of gradient accumulation steps. Adjust this value for gradient accumulation to save GPU memory.

- `NUM_CLASSES`: The number of classes in the STL-10 dataset. By default, it's set to 10.

- `EPOCHS`: The number of training epochs.

## Mixed Precision Training

This code utilizes mixed precision training for faster training and reduced GPU memory consumption. It leverages the `autocast` and `GradScaler` from PyTorch's `torch.cuda.amp` module.

## Dataset Split

The code splits the STL-10 dataset into training, validation, and test sets. By default, it uses 80% of the data for training and 20% for validation. The test set is separate and used for evaluating the model's final performance.
